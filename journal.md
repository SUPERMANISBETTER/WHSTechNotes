The New Cell Phone Policy
I think it is wrong to not have our phones during school hours. because we need to get entertained and in case our family members or friends text us,we should asnwer if emergency.At Least let us have our phones during lunch as our breal.
Evidence shows that the negative effects of a school-wide phone ban can include increased student anxiety and distress, especially on non-phone days, without a proven improvement in academic performance or overall mental health. Bans may also prevent students from contacting parents for emergencies, and while they can reduce classroom distraction, a more balanced approach might be more effective than a complete restriction.
this proves that them without their phones can lead to sickness or axienty if they're not on their phone in time. 
PLEASE LET US HAVE OUR PHONE BACK!!!

Im interested on being a mechanic which technology helps by mechanics in almost every aspect of their work, from highly accurate diagnostic tools to software that manages the entire repair process. This shift from purely manual work to tech-driven diagnostics and communication increases efficiency, accuracy, and customer satisfaction.

Claim:My idea for this AI project is to have it talk about how a government runs through the wolrd
Evidence:
The Presidential AI Challenge was officially launched by the White House on August 26, 2025, to inspire Kâ€“12 students, educators, and mentors to use artificial intelligence (AI) to solve real-world community problems. The challenge was mandated by Executive Order 14277, "Advancing Artificial Intelligence Education for American Youth," which President Donald J. Trump signed on April 23, 2025. 
Reasoning:I believe this is to teach students and children about solving the world's problems and how to make it better for the world and the people

I think working in a virtural store is a good idea
Applications for roles in the virtual store open today (3rd June, 2024) and close on Sunday 16th June, with paid shifts for 10 new co-workers up for grabs. Successful applicants will be able to flex their skills, help customers, and get promoted to move departments, just like in the real world.   
It supports by helping workers to actually work for something good
